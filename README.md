# Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) Parts of Speech Analysis
### Scraping and Part of Speech Analysis of the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)

In this project, I am scraping the [TEKS website](https://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.ViewTAC?tac_view=3&ti=19&pt=2) for all subjects in grades 4-8. Then I will be conducting a part of speech analysis by finding the most common verbs across all grades and subjects. 

This is a volunteer project in support of [Celebrate Dyslexia](https://celebratedyslexia.org/), a non-profit organization in Texas. Their mission is to foster a community that celebrates, educates and empowers those with Dyslexia. With the results of this analysis, the team at Celebrate Dyslexia will be empowered to create a curriculum that supplements TEKS in order to better support children in grades 4-8 who have Dyslexia.
