2,"(3) Scientific investigation and reasoning. The student uses critical thinking and scientific problem solving to make informed decisions. The student is expected to: (A) analyze, evaluate, and critique scientific explanations by using evidence, logical reasoning, and experimental and observational testing; (B) draw or develop a model that represents how something that cannot be seen such as the Sun, Earth, and Moon system and formation of sedimentary rock works or looks; and (C) connect grade-level appropriate science concepts with the history of science, science careers, and contributions of scientists.",use; solve; make; expect; evaluate; critique; use; draw; develop; represent; see; connect,Grade 5,SCIENCE
3,"(4) Scientific investigation and reasoning. The student knows how to use a variety of tools and methods to conduct science inquiry. The student is expected to collect, record, and analyze information using tools, including calculators, microscopes, cameras, computers, hand lenses, metric rulers, Celsius thermometers, prisms, mirrors, balances, spring scales, graduated cylinders, beakers, hot plates, meter sticks, magnets, collecting nets, and notebooks; timing devices; and materials to support observations of habitats or organisms such as terrariums and aquariums.",know; use; conduct; expect; collect; analyze; use; include; graduate; collect; time; support,Grade 5,SCIENCE
4,"(5) Matter and energy. The student knows that matter has measurable physical properties and those properties determine how matter is classified, changed, and used. The student is expected to: (A) classify matter based on measurable, testable, and observable physical properties, including mass, magnetism, physical state (solid, liquid, and gas), relative density (sinking and floating using water as a reference point), solubility in water, and the ability to conduct or insulate thermal energy or electric energy; (B) demonstrate that some mixtures maintain physical properties of their ingredients such as iron filings and sand and sand and water; and (C) identify changes that can occur in the physical properties of the ingredients of solutions such as dissolving salt in water or adding lemon juice to water.",know; determine; classify; change; use; expect; base; include; sink; float; use; conduct; insulate; demonstrate; maintain; identify; occur; dissolve; add,Grade 5,SCIENCE
5,"(6) Force, motion, and energy. The student knows that energy occurs in many forms and can be observed in cycles, patterns, and systems. The student is expected to: (A) explore the uses of energy, including mechanical, light, thermal, electrical, and sound energy; (B) demonstrate that the flow of electricity in closed circuits can produce light, heat, or sound; (C) demonstrate that light travels in a straight line until it strikes an object and is reflected or travels through one medium to another and is refracted; and (D) design a simple experimental investigation that tests the effect of force on an object.",know; occur; observe; expect; explore; include; demonstrate; produce; sound; demonstrate; travel; strike; reflect; travel; refract; design; test,Grade 5,SCIENCE
6,"(7) Earth and space. The student knows Earth's surface is constantly changing and consists of useful resources. The student is expected to: (A) explore the processes that led to the formation of sedimentary rocks and fossil fuels; and (B) recognize how landforms such as deltas, canyons, and sand dunes are the result of changes to Earth's surface by wind, water, or ice.",know; change; consist; expect; explore; lead; recognize,Grade 5,SCIENCE
7,"(8) Earth and space. The student knows that there are recognizable patterns in the natural world and among the Sun, Earth, and Moon system. The student is expected to: (A) differentiate between weather and climate; (B) explain how the Sun and the ocean interact in the water cycle; (C) demonstrate that Earth rotates on its axis once approximately every 24 hours causing the day/night cycle and the apparent movement of the Sun across the sky; and (D) identify and compare the physical characteristics of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.",know; be; expect; explain; demonstrate; rotate; cause; identify; compare,Grade 5,SCIENCE
8,"(9) Organisms and environments. The student knows that there are relationships, systems, and cycles within environments. The student is expected to: (A) observe the way organisms live and survive in their ecosystem by interacting with the living and nonliving components; (B) describe the flow of energy within a food web, including the roles of the Sun, producers, consumers, and decomposers; (C) predict the effects of changes in ecosystems caused by living organisms, including humans, such as the overpopulation of grazers or the building of highways; and (D) identify fossils as evidence of past living organisms and the nature of the environments at the time using models.",know; be; expect; observe; live; survive; interact; describe; include; predict; cause; include; identify; live; use,Grade 5,SCIENCE
