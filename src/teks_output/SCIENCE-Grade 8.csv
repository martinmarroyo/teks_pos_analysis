The student is expected to: (A) demonstrate and calculate how unbalanced forces change the speed or direction of an object's motion; (B) differentiate between speed, velocity, and acceleration; and (C) investigate and describe applications of Newton's three laws of motion such as in vehicle restraints, sports activities, amusement park rides, Earth's tectonic activities, and rocket launches.",know; be; expect; calculate; change; investigate; describe,Grade 8,SCIENCE
6,"(7) Earth and space. The student knows the effects resulting from cyclical movements of the Sun, Earth, and Moon. The student is expected to: (A) model and illustrate how the tilted Earth rotates on its axis, causing day and night, and revolves around the Sun, causing changes in seasons; (B) demonstrate and predict the sequence of events in the lunar cycle; and (C) relate the positions of the Moon and Sun to their effect on ocean tides.",know; result; expect; illustrate; tilt; rotate; cause; revolve; cause; demonstrate; predict; relate,Grade 8,SCIENCE
7,"(8) Earth and space. The student knows characteristics of the universe. The student is expected to: (A) describe components of the universe, including stars, nebulae, and galaxies, and use models such as the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for classification; (B) recognize that the Sun is a medium-sized star located in a spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy and that the Sun is many thousands of times closer to Earth than any other star; (C) identify how different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum such as visible light and radio waves are used to gain information about components in the universe; and (D) research how scientific data are used as evidence to develop scientific theories to describe the origin of the universe.",know; expect; describe; include; recognize; locate; identify; use; gain; use; develop; describe,Grade 8,SCIENCE
