Some energy resources, once depleted, are essentially nonrenewable. The student is expected to research and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear power, biomass, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and solar resources.",know; renew; deplete; expect; research; discuss; use,Grade 6,SCIENCE
7,"(8) Force, motion, and energy. The student knows force and motion are related to potential and kinetic energy. The student is expected to: (A) compare and contrast potential and kinetic energy; (B) identify and describe the changes in position, direction, and speed of an object when acted upon by unbalanced forces; (C) calculate average speed using distance and time measurements; (D) measure and graph changes in motion; and (E) investigate how inclined planes can be used to change the amount of force to move an object.",know; relate; expect; contrast; identify; describe; act; calculate; use; investigate; use; change; move,Grade 6,SCIENCE
8,"(9) Force, motion, and energy. The student knows that the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, it just changes form. The student is expected to: (A) investigate methods of thermal energy transfer, including conduction, convection, and radiation; (B) verify through investigations that thermal energy moves in a predictable pattern from warmer to cooler until all the substances attain the same temperature such as an ice cube melting; and (C) demonstrate energy transformations such as energy in a flashlight battery changes from chemical energy to electrical energy to light energy.",know; create; destroy; change; expect; include; verify; cooler; attain; demonstrate,Grade 6,SCIENCE
