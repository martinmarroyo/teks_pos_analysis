0,"(1) The ELLA Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) embody the interconnected nature of listening, speaking, reading, writing, and thinking through the seven integrated strands of developing and sustaining foundational language skills; comprehension; response; multiple genres; author's purpose and craft; composition; and inquiry and research. The strands focus on academic oracy (proficiency in oral expression and comprehension), authentic reading, and reflective writing to ensure a literate Texas. The strands are integrated and progressive with students continuing to develop knowledge and skills with increased complexity and nuance in order to think critically and adapt to the ever-evolving nature of language and literacy.",embody; interconnect; listen; speak; think; integrate; develop; sustain; focus; ensure; integrate; continue; develop; increase; think; adapt; evolve,Grade 7,SPANISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND READING AND ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE
1,"(2) The seven strands of this course mirror the essential knowledge and skills for English language arts and reading, which are intended to be integrated for instructional purposes and are recursive in nature. Strands include the four domains of language (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) and their application in order to accelerate the acquisition of language skills so that students develop high levels of social and academic language proficiency. Although some strands may require more instructional time, each strand is of equal value, may be presented in any order, and should be integrated throughout the year. Additionally, students should engage in academic conversations, write, read, and be read to on a daily basis with opportunities for cross-curricular content and student choice.",mirror; intend; integrate; include; listen; speak; accelerate; develop; require; present; integrate; engage; read; read,Grade 7,SPANISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND READING AND ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE
2,"(3) Text complexity increases with challenging vocabulary, sophisticated sentence structures, nuanced text features, cognitively demanding content, and subtle relationships among ideas (Texas Education Agency, STAAR Performance Level Descriptors, 2013). As skills and knowledge are obtained in each of the seven strands, students will continue to apply earlier standards with greater depth to increasingly complex texts in multiple genres as they become self-directed, critical learners who work collaboratively while continuously using metacognitive skills.",increase; nuance; demand; obtain; continue; apply; become; direct; work; use,Grade 7,SPANISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND READING AND ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE
3,"(4) ELLs are expected to meet standards in a second language; however, their proficiency in English influences the ability to meet these standards. To demonstrate this knowledge throughout the stages of English language acquisition, comprehension of text requires additional scaffolds such as adapted text, translations, native language support, cognates, summaries, pictures, realia, glossaries, bilingual dictionaries, thesauri, and other modes of comprehensible input. ELLs can and should be encouraged to use knowledge of their first language to enhance vocabulary development; vocabulary needs to be in the context of connected discourse so that it is meaningful. Strategic use of the student's first language is important to ensure linguistic, affective, cognitive, and academic development in English.",expect; meet; meet; demonstrate; require; adapt; encourage; use; enhance; need; ensure,Grade 7,SPANISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND READING AND ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE
4,"(5) Current research stresses the importance of effectively integrating second language acquisition with quality content area education in order to ensure that ELLs acquire social and academic language proficiency in English, learn the knowledge and skills, and reach their full academic potential. Instruction must be linguistically accommodated in accordance with the English Language Proficiency Standards (ELPS) and the student's English language proficiency levels to ensure the mastery of knowledge and skills in the required curriculum is accessible. For a further understanding of second language acquisition needs, refer to the ELPS and proficiency-level descriptors adopted in Chapter 74, Subchapter A, of this title (relating to Required Curriculum).",stress; integrate; ensure; acquire; learn; reach; accommodate; ensure; require; refer; adopt; relate,Grade 7,SPANISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND READING AND ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE
5,"(6) Oral language proficiency holds a pivotal role in school success; verbal engagement must be maximized across grade levels (Kinsella, 2010). In order for students to become thinkers and proficient speakers in science, social studies, mathematics, fine arts, language arts and reading, and career and technical education, they must have multiple opportunities to practice and apply the academic language of each discipline (Fisher, Frey, & Rothenberg, 2008).",hold; maximize; become; have; practice; apply,Grade 7,SPANISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND READING AND ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE

7,"(10) Author's purpose and craft: listening, speaking, reading, writing, and thinking using multiple texts. The student uses critical inquiry to analyze the authors' choices and how they influence and communicate meaning within a variety of texts. The student analyzes and applies author's craft purposefully in order to develop his or her own products and performances. Based on the student's language proficiency level, the student is expected to: (A) explain the author's purpose and message within a text; (B) analyze how the use of text structure contributes to the author's purpose; (C) analyze the author's use of print and graphic features to achieve specific purposes; (D) describe how the author's use of figurative language such as metaphor and personification achieves specific purposes; (E) identify the use of literary devices, including subjective and objective point of view; (F) analyze how the author's use of language contributes to mood, voice, and tone; and (G) explain the purpose of rhetorical devices such as direct address and rhetorical questions and logical fallacies such as loaded language and sweeping generalizations.",listen; speak; think; use; use; analyze; influence; communicate; analyze; apply; develop; base; expect; explain; analyze; contribute; analyze; achieve; describe; achieve; identify; include; analyze; contribute; explain; load,Grade 7,SPANISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND READING AND ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE
8,"(11) Composition: listening, speaking, reading, writing, and thinking using multiple texts--writing process. The student uses the writing process recursively to compose multiple texts that are legible and uses appropriate conventions. Based on the student's language proficiency level, the student is expected to: (A) plan a first draft by selecting a genre appropriate for a particular topic, purpose, and audience using a range of strategies such as discussion, background reading, and personal interests; (B) develop drafts into a focused, structured, and coherent piece of writing by: (i) organizing with purposeful structure, including an introduction, transitions, coherence within and across paragraphs, and a conclusion; and (ii) developing an engaging idea reflecting depth of thought with specific facts, details, and examples; (C) revise drafts for clarity, development, organization, style, word choice, and sentence variety; (D) edit drafts using standard English conventions, including: (i) complete simple, compound, and complex sentences with subject-verb agreement and avoidance of splices, run-ons, and fragments; (ii) consistent, appropriate use of verb tenses; (iii) conjunctive adverbs; (iv) prepositions and prepositional phrases and their influence on subject-verb agreement; (v) pronoun-antecedent agreement; (vi) subordinating conjunctions to form complex sentences and correlative conjunctions such as either/or and neither/nor; (vii) correct capitalization; (viii) punctuation, including commas to set off words, phrases, and clauses and semicolons; and (ix) correct spelling, including commonly confused terms such as its/it's, affect/effect, there/their/they're, and to/two/too; and (E) publish written work for appropriate audiences.",speak; think; use; use; compose; use; base; expect; select; use; develop; organize; include; develop; reflect; revise; use; include; complete; verb; subordinate; form; include; set; include; confuse; affect; publish; write,Grade 7,SPANISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND READING AND ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE
